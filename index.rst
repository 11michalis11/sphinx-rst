===============================
Get started with Sphinx and rST
===============================

This short tutorial introduces you to the basics of creating and editing
documentation using *Sphinx*, a documentation generation system, and
*RestructuredText* (rST), a documentation markup language.

It also covers using Read The Docs, a popular documentation hosting system,
to publish documentation.

---------

Parts 1 and 2 introduce the basics of rST, and show how to use GitHub's web
interface to make changes to documentation content.

Parts 3 and 4 require some basic software skills. They cover creating a
documentation project from scratch, customising it and publishing it using Read
the Docs. They also introduce more complex rST/Sphinx functionality.
