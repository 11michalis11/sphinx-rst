===============================
Get started with Sphinx and rST
===============================

This short tutorial introduces you to the basics of creating and editing
documentation using *Sphinx*, a documentation generation system, and
*reStructuredText* (rST), a documentation markup language.

It also covers using Read The Docs, a popular documentation hosting system,
to publish documentation.


How it works
============

In this tutorial you jump straight in and start editing.

First you'll explore rST in the sandbox provided by the GitHub wiki, and then
you'll make changes to the source material of the tutorial itself (by adding
yourself to the :doc:`register`, to show that you've done it).

After that, you'll go on to create new material of your own.

Since the tutorial is created using exactly the same tools and process that it
aims to help you learn, you might find some opportunities to improve the
tutorial itself by proposing changes - please do.


What to do
==========

Work through parts 1-4 below in sequence (if you want to jump straight to part
3, that will also work).

Parts 1 and 2 introduce the basics of rST, and show how to use GitHub's web
interface to make changes to documentation content.

Parts 3 and 4 require some basic software skills. They cover creating a
documentation project from scratch, customising it and publishing it using Read
the Docs. They also introduce more complex rST/Sphinx functionality.
